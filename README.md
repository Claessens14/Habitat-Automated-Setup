# Habitat-Automated-Setup (WIP)
A simple script to automate the setup process of Habitat AI 

### Warning
 - The script fails for me, however even in failure is a concise way to access all the needed commands. 
 - The script does not use the CUDA flag yet  
 - If the install fails, you will need to comment out (`#`) sections of the script to re-run (ie. conda create, git clone)
 - Mac specific issues are addressed in comments in the script.

### Setup
Reguires a Posix terminal (Bash, Zsh etc).  
Turn the script into an executable
  ```
  chmod +x setup.sh
  ```
### Run: 
  ```
  ./setup.sh
  ```
### Notes
 - ChatGPT helped with creating some of the bash commands and comments.
