# Habitat-Automated-Setup (WIP)
A simple script to automate the setup process of Habitat AI 

### Warning
The script fails for me, however it is a concise way to access all the needed commands. 

### Setup
Reguires a Posix terminal (Bash, Zsh etc).  
Turn the script into an executable
  ```
  chmod +x setup.sh
  ```
Run: 
  ```
  ./setup.sh
  ```
